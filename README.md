# Password Strength Checker

   This Python script evaluates the strength of a user-provided password. It calculates the following metrics:
Length: Ensures the password falls within the range of 5 to 127 characters.
Lowercase Letters: Counts the number of lowercase alphabets.
Uppercase Letters: Counts the number of uppercase alphabets.
Digits: Tallies the digits present in the password.
Special Characters: Identifies and counts special characters (e.g., symbols, punctuation).

   The script then computes the entropy of the password, which measures its unpredictability based on the character pool size. Finally, it provides remarks on the passwordâ€™s strength level.
